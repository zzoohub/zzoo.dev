title: "Mealio — Case Study"

## Problem

Most meal tracking apps demand tedious manual input — searching databases, weighing portions, typing descriptions. The friction is so high that users abandon logging within days. I wanted a meal tracker that felt as natural as taking a photo: snap, tag, done.

## Solution

Mealio is a photo-first meal tracking app designed around a single principle: **log a meal in under 1 second**. The camera is the primary interface. Users snap a photo, add optional nutrition details, and build a visual food diary over time.

### Key Design Decisions

- **Camera-centric UX** — The capture flow is the core experience. Photo first, details optional. This dramatically lowers the barrier to consistent logging.
- **Dual-mode architecture** — Guest mode (local storage, max 10 entries) lets users try the app instantly. Authenticated mode unlocks cloud sync, unlimited entries, and statistics.
- **Feature-Sliced Design** — The mobile codebase follows strict layer boundaries (`app → widgets → features → entities → shared`) for maintainable growth.
- **Rust API** — Chose Axum over Node.js for type safety, performance, and memory efficiency on Cloud Run's autoscaling (0–3 instances).

## Results

- **1-second capture flow** — From camera tap to saved entry, consistently under 1 second
- **Cross-platform** — Single codebase serving both iOS (App Store) and Android (Play Store)
- **Zero-to-three autoscaling** — Cloud Run scales to zero when idle, keeping costs minimal
- **9 database migrations** — Stable schema evolution without downtime
- **4 CI/CD pipelines** — Automated API deploy, mobile CI, EAS builds, and OTA updates
