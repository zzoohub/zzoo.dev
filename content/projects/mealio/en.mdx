## Tried tracking meals before?

You probably lasted about 3 days. Most meal tracking apps make you search a calorie database, weigh portions, and type descriptions. By day 3, you're logging "lunch" with no details — or not logging at all.

The problem isn't you. The problem is friction.

## Photo first, everything else optional

Mealio flips the script: **your camera is the input**. Take a photo of your meal, add a quick tag if you want, and move on. Your visual food diary builds itself over time.

No calorie databases. No portion sizes. No guilt about missing details. Just an honest record of what you actually ate.

## How it works

1. **Tap the camera** — it's the main button, right where your thumb lands
2. **Snap your meal** — one photo, that's all it takes
3. **Add details (optional)** — tags, notes, nutrition info if you want
4. **Done in 15 seconds** — your meal is logged with a timestamped photo

## Try before you sign up

Guest mode gives you 10 free entries stored locally on your device. No email, no password, no credit card. Just open the app and start logging. When you're ready for cloud sync, unlimited entries, and stats — sign up takes 30 seconds.
