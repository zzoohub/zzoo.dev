## Overview

A fintech startup needed a real-time analytics dashboard to visualize financial market data for their institutional clients. The existing solution was a legacy Java application that couldn't handle the data volume required for real-time analysis.

## The Problem

- **Latency:** The existing system had 5-10 second delays in data display, unacceptable for financial trading decisions.
- **Scale:** During market open hours, the system needed to process 100K+ events per second.
- **Reliability:** The legacy system experienced frequent downtime during peak trading hours.

## The Solution

I designed a two-tier architecture:

1. **Ingestion Layer (Go):** A high-performance Go service processes incoming market data events, performs aggregation, and writes to ClickHouse. The service uses worker pools and batched writes to maximize throughput.

2. **Frontend (React):** A responsive dashboard built with React, using WebSocket connections for real-time data streaming. Charts render with `<canvas>` for 60fps performance even with thousands of data points.

Key technical decisions:
- **ClickHouse** for time-series data — 10x faster than PostgreSQL for analytical queries
- **WebSocket** with binary protocol for minimal overhead
- **Virtual scrolling** for tables with 100K+ rows

## Results

- **3x** faster data processing compared to the legacy system
- **99.9%** uptime over the first 6 months
- **Sub-200ms** latency from event ingestion to dashboard display
