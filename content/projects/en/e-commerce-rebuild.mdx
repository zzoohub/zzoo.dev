## Overview

The client, a mid-sized fashion retailer, was struggling with a 5-year-old monolithic application that was becoming increasingly difficult to maintain. Page load times were averaging 4+ seconds, leading to significant bounce rates on mobile devices.

My role was to architect and execute a complete rebuild, decoupling the frontend from the backend to enable a modern, headless commerce experience.

## The Problem

- **Technical Debt:** The legacy codebase was fragile, with simple updates taking days to deploy due to lack of automated testing.
- **Performance:** Server-side rendering time was slow, and caching strategies were inefficient during high-traffic sales events.
- **Scalability:** The database was a single point of failure, often locking up during concurrent write operations.

## The Solution

We moved to a Jamstack architecture. By pre-rendering critical pages and using edge functions for dynamic content, we drastically reduced Time to First Byte (TTFB).

The checkout flow was rebuilt with optimistic UI updates and client-side validation, reducing the perceived wait time for customers.

Key architectural decisions:
- **Static generation** for product listing pages
- **Edge functions** for personalized content and pricing
- **Redis caching** for session management and cart persistence
- **PostgreSQL** with read replicas for database scaling

## Results

The impact was measurable within the first month of launch:

- **40%** faster page loads (4.2s → 2.5s average)
- **25%** increase in conversion rate
- **99.9%** uptime during peak sales events
