## Overview

A growing SaaS company with 4 separate product lines had no shared design language. Each product team built their own components from scratch, leading to visual inconsistency and duplicated effort.

## The Problem

- **Inconsistency:** Users navigating between products experienced jarring design differences.
- **Slow development:** Each new feature required building UI components from zero.
- **Designer-developer gap:** Designers created mockups that developers interpreted differently.

## The Solution

I established a comprehensive design system with three layers:

1. **Design tokens:** Color, spacing, typography, and shadow values defined as CSS custom properties and synced with Figma variables.
2. **Core components:** A library of 40+ React components with comprehensive props, accessibility built-in, and Storybook documentation.
3. **Pattern library:** Common page layouts and interaction patterns documented with usage guidelines.
