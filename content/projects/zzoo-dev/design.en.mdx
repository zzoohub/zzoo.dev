## Technical Approach

Every page is statically generated (SSG) at build time. With no server-side rendering or API routes, pages are served directly from Cloudflare Pages' global edge network — fast regardless of where visitors connect from.

Content is managed as MDX files. Each piece is split into `content/[type]/[slug]/en.mdx` and `ko.mdx`, keeping translations independent. Architecture diagrams written in D2 are automatically compiled into SVGs in both light and dark theme variants at build time.

The UI is built with Tailwind CSS v4 and shadcn/ui. The CSS variable-based theming system makes dark mode transitions seamless, and components built on Radix primitives ensure accessibility by default.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology | Why |
|-------|-----------|-----|
| Framework | Next.js 16 (App Router) | React 19 support, ecosystem optimized for static generation |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS v4 + shadcn/ui | Utility-first + accessible components |
| Content | MDX + gray-matter | React components inside markdown |
| i18n | next-intl | Battle-tested i18n with static export support |
| Diagrams | D2 | Version-controllable declarative diagrams |
| Hosting | Cloudflare Pages | Global edge CDN, free tier is more than enough |
| Testing | Vitest + Testing Library | Fast unit tests |
