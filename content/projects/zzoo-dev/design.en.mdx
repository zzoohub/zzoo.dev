## Technical Approach

Every page is statically generated (SSG) at build time. With no server-side rendering or API routes, pages are served directly from Cloudflare Pages' global edge network — fast regardless of where visitors connect from.

Content is managed as MDX files. Each piece is split into `content/[type]/[slug]/en.mdx` and `ko.mdx`, keeping translations independent. Architecture diagrams written in D2 are automatically compiled into SVGs in both light and dark theme variants at build time.

The UI is built with Tailwind CSS v4 and shadcn/ui. The CSS variable-based theming system makes dark mode transitions seamless, and components built on Radix primitives ensure accessibility by default.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology | Why |
|-------|-----------|-----|
| Framework | Next.js 16 (App Router) | React 19 support, ecosystem optimized for static generation |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS v4 + shadcn/ui | Utility-first + accessible components |
| Content | MDX + gray-matter | React components inside markdown |
| i18n | next-intl | Battle-tested i18n with static export support |
| Diagrams | D2 | Version-controllable declarative diagrams |
| Hosting | Cloudflare Workers | Global edge CDN, free tier is more than enough |
| Testing | Vitest + Testing Library | Fast unit tests |

## Search Visibility Strategy

The site implements a layered approach to search visibility, targeting three distinct discovery channels.

### SEO Layer

- **SSG + Edge delivery** — Every page is pre-rendered at build time and served from Cloudflare's edge network, achieving sub-second FCP
- **Semantic HTML** — Proper heading hierarchy (`h1` → `h2` → `h3`), landmark roles, and accessible markup
- **Hreflang alternates** — XML sitemap and `<link rel="alternate">` tags for EN/KO, so search engines serve the right language
- **Canonical URLs** — Each page declares its canonical URL to prevent duplicate content issues across locales
- **Performance** — Lighthouse 95+ target, initial JS < 100KB gzipped

### AEO Layer

- **JSON-LD schemas** — `WebSite`, `Person`, `BlogPosting`, `SoftwareApplication`, and `BreadcrumbList` are embedded on relevant pages via `<script type="application/ld+json">`
- **RSS feed** — Auto-generated from EN blog posts at build time, giving answer engines a real-time content pipeline
- **`robots.txt`** — Generated via Next.js route handler, allowing all major crawlers
- **Open Graph + Twitter Cards** — Every page has OG metadata with a default 1200x630 image

### GEO Layer

- **`llms.txt`** — A plain-text file at `/llms.txt` describing the site's purpose, author, structure, and content inventory in a format optimized for LLM consumption
- **Clean MDX content** — Blog posts and case studies are written in well-structured MDX with clear headings, making it easy for generative models to extract and cite
- **Bilingual coverage** — EN and KO versions of all content double the surface area for language-specific AI queries
