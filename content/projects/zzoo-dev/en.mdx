## The invisible developer problem

You build great things but nobody finds you. Your portfolio gets a dozen visits a month — all from people who already have your URL. Meanwhile, potential clients and hiring managers are searching Google, asking ChatGPT, or browsing Perplexity for developers just like you.

If your site isn't optimized for these channels, you're invisible to 99% of the people looking for your skills.

## Built for three discovery channels

zzoo.dev isn't just a pretty portfolio. It's engineered to be discovered:

**SEO** — Statically generated pages, semantic HTML, XML sitemap with hreflang, canonical URLs. The technical foundation that gets you indexed.

**AEO** — JSON-LD schemas (`Person`, `WebSite`, `BlogPosting`, `SoftwareApplication`, `BreadcrumbList`) give AI answer engines structured context about your expertise.

**GEO** — `llms.txt` and clean MDX content let generative AI engines accurately represent your work when someone asks "who can build my app?"

## Open source, fork-friendly

The entire codebase is open source. It's built with Next.js 16, React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS v4, and deployed to Cloudflare Workers. Clone it, customize it, ship your own version.
