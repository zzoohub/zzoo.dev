As a solo developer, I realized that traditional portfolio sites have clear limitations. Listing tech stacks and pasting screenshots isn't enough to build trust with potential clients, nor is it sufficient for AI search engines to understand and recommend my expertise.

zzoo.dev is a personal branding site built to address both of these. It shows what problems I've actually solved through project experience, and shares my thought process through technical blog posts. The site supports both English and Korean, and uses machine-readable metadata like `llms.txt` and JSON-LD so AI systems can accurately index the content.

## Site Structure

The site is designed so visitors naturally build trust as they browse. From the home page they flow into project write-ups and blog posts, and interested visitors move on to the about page and contact.

- **Home** — A landing page that showcases core expertise and featured projects at a glance
- **Products** — Write-ups covering the background, approach, and technical architecture of each project
- **Blog** — Posts sharing technical decisions and experiences
- **About** — Career background and bio
- **Contact** — Simple email-based contact
