## Sound familiar?

You install a site blocker. You add Twitter, YouTube Shorts, Reddit. You feel productive for about 2 hours. Then you click "disable for 5 minutes" and the entire afternoon disappears.

Every blocker gives you an escape hatch. Passwords, timers, cooldowns — they all assume you'll resist temptation in the moment. But that's exactly when you won't.

## The radical solution: no escape

Permanent Site Blocker has no unblock button. No password bypass. No timer. No "just 5 more minutes."

Once a site is blocked, the only way to remove the block is to **completely reinstall the extension** — which means you lose your entire blocklist and start over. That friction is the feature.

## Block what actually distracts you

Not all of YouTube is a time sink. Shorts is. Not all of Reddit is bad. Just the front page rabbit hole. The extension lets you be precise:

- **Full domain** — `twitter.com` blocks everything (including `www.`)
- **Specific paths** — `youtube.com/shorts` blocks only Shorts
- **Regex patterns** — `youtube\.com.*[가-힣]` blocks Korean YouTube content

## No data leaves your browser

Zero analytics. Zero external servers. Zero npm dependencies. The entire extension is ~300 lines of vanilla JavaScript. Your blocklist syncs across Chrome devices using Chrome's own storage infrastructure. Nothing else touches your data.
