I'm a web developer with 4 years of experience. Right now, I'm deep into AI-powered development. I believe AI is fundamentally changing how we build software, and I'm all in on using it to ship faster and build things that wouldn't be possible solo otherwise.

Outside of building things, I'm interested in living a healthy life and web3.
