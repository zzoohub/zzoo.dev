The tools available to solo developers today are unprecedented. Cloud infrastructure, AI assistants, and modern frameworks make it possible for one person to build, deploy, and maintain products that would have required a team of ten just five years ago.

## The Full-Product Developer

Being a solopreneur in tech isn't just about writing code. It's about understanding the entire product lifecycle — from user research to deployment to customer support. This is what I call the "full-product developer."

## Why Now?

Several trends converge to make this the best time to go solo:

- **AI-assisted development** dramatically increases individual output
- **Serverless platforms** eliminate infrastructure management
- **Modern frameworks** handle 90% of common patterns out of the box
- **Remote-first culture** means clients care about output, not office presence

## The Economic Argument

A solo developer with the right tools and skills can deliver faster than a small agency, with lower overhead and more direct communication. Clients get a single point of contact who understands every layer of the stack.

## The Challenges

It's not all upside. Isolation, scope management, and the constant context-switching between coding and business are real challenges. But for those who thrive on autonomy, the trade-off is worth it.

The future belongs to developers who can think like product owners and ship like engineers.
