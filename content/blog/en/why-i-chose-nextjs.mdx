When building a modern web application, the choice of framework is critical. It's not just about what's popular right now, but what provides the best developer experience and end-user performance. For me, that answer was **Next.js**.

## The Need for Velocity

This is the most important decision because when you are in a team of one, I needed a platform, not a library. Next.js gives me routing, SSG, image optimization, and deployment — all in one package.

For my blog posts and case studies, I use **MDX** with `next-mdx-remote`. This lets me embed React components directly in markdown, which is perfect for interactive code examples and architecture diagrams.

```tsx
// Simple static generation with Next.js App Router
export async function generateStaticParams() {
  const posts = await getAllPosts("en");
  return posts.map((post) => ({ slug: post.slug }));
}
```

## Configuring for Performance

Out of the box, the App Router is incredible. But what really impressed me was how easy it was to achieve sub-1-second First Contentful Paint with static generation.

The key was keeping the initial JavaScript bundle under 100KB gzipped. By using server components by default and only opting into client components where interactivity was truly needed, the bundle stayed lean.

## The Ecosystem Advantage

Beyond the code, the ecosystem is vast. Whether I'm looking for authentication, database ORMs, or deployment platforms — Next.js has first-class support. Being able to deploy to Cloudflare Pages with `@opennextjs/cloudflare` gives me edge performance globally.

## Conclusion

Ultimately, the best tool is the one that fits your needs. For my portfolio, Next.js ticked all the boxes: speed, developer experience, and scalability.
