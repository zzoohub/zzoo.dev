I've worked with developers like this. Give them a task and they deliver. Code quality is decent, deadlines are met. But they never build anything on their own. Say "implement this" and they do. They never say "what if we built this?"

Five years ago, that was a perfectly fine developer. Not anymore.

## The Cost of Code Is Going to Zero

This isn't hyperbole. Features that took a full day six months ago now ship in an hour. AI coding tools get faster and more accurate every month. The raw cost of "writing code" is rapidly converging to zero.

This poses an existential question for developers: **When the cost of writing code approaches free, where is the value in knowing how to code?**

The answer is simple. It isn't in the code itself.

## Two Kinds of Developers

Developers roughly fall into two categories.

**Builders**: They find problems, imagine solutions, and create. Code is the means, not the end. They spend energy on "what if we solve this problem like this?" rather than "implement this feature for me."

**Executors**: Given a spec, they implement precisely. They write clean code and hit deadlines. But without a spec, they stall. They rarely decide what to build on their own.

Before AI, you needed both. Builders set direction, executors shipped features. The more executors on a team, the more features you could push out, faster.

But AI has started replacing the executor's role. Code conversion, boilerplate generation, test writing, bug fixing — given a clear spec, AI handles it. And it keeps getting better.

**Builders don't get replaced.** The ability to decide "what should we build?" can't be delegated to AI. Not yet.

## Both Ends of the Frontier

There are exceptions, of course. Not every domain shifts uniformly.

**Deep-tech engineering** — Infrastructure for training AI models, real-time control systems in robotics, kernel development, compiler design. Here, a single mistake is catastrophic, and defining the problem itself requires deep expertise. Pure technical depth remains the highest-value skill. The small number of engineers with frontier-level capabilities won't be shaken by the AI era.

**Service development** — Most web services, mobile apps, SaaS products. Technical difficulty in this space is rapidly flattening. The ability to write CRUD is not a differentiator.

Most developers fall into the latter category. And in this space, the rules of the game are changing.

## The Age of Makers

What happens when the cost of development converges to zero? The developer's role shifts closer to **creator** territory.

Just as YouTubers differentiate on content instinct rather than camera technique, developers will differentiate on **what they build** rather than how well they code. Cheaper filming and editing didn't kill YouTube — it created an explosion of creators. The same will happen with development.

When AI lowers the barrier to building, more people build more things. But the people who build **something meaningful** remain rare. Meaning comes from taste, not technique.

## Taste as a Moat

Developers who survive in the service space share two kinds of taste:

**Domain taste** — The ability to understand problems, not just technology. If you're building fintech, knowing financial regulations and user psychology around money. If you're building a healthcare app, understanding medical workflows and compliance. AI can write the code, but it won't tell you which problem actually hurts and where the money is.

**UX taste** — Knowing what users want, where they get stuck, what makes them feel good. The same feature, presented differently, either gets used or gets abandoned. Reading data, observing user behavior, intuitively reducing friction — this doesn't come from code.

These two senses are hard for AI to replicate. Domain knowledge comes from field experience. UX taste comes from relentless observation and experimentation. As the ability to write code becomes commoditized, these become a developer's real moat.

## So What Should You Do?

Here's a concrete strategy:

**Build something.** Beyond your day job, create a product of your own. Not a side project — a real product with real users. Going through the full cycle from ideation to deployment to operations shifts your perspective from "person who does assigned work" to "person who finds and solves problems."

**Go deep into a domain.** The meaning of "full-stack" is changing. It's no longer frontend + backend + infra. It's technology + domain + UX. Pick an industry you care about and go deep.

**Watch your users.** Spend as much time on user reviews as you do on code reviews. Turn on your analytics, see where users drop off, think about why. UX taste isn't innate — it's trained through practice.

**Use AI as leverage.** Don't fight in the space AI is replacing. Use AI as a tool so one person does the work of ten. The time you save writing code — spend it thinking about what to build.

## Conclusion

The developer who matters in the AI era isn't the one who writes the best code. It's **the one who knows what to build**.

Code is becoming free. Taste is becoming expensive.

A developer with no interest in building things is, frankly, in danger now. If the interest isn't there, change — or AI will change things for you.

Live as a builder. The tools keep getting better.
